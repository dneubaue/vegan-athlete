###Do vegan athletes need to sacrifice their beliefs in order to win?

In a race between a vegan and a carnivore, who comes in first? When it comes to sports, athletes look for any possible edge to gain over their opponents. They spend thousands of dollars on top of the line equipment, invest in personal trainers or coaches, and some look to their diet to provide for the optimal nutrition. For many athletes, a vegan diet may be seen as taboo because athletes need to be strong and muscular and according to the social norm, these traits can only be attained through eating meat. However, what if an athlete chose to be vegan for ethical reasons, meaning they choose to not eat meat because they disagree with the consumption of animal products? Would the athlete be at an immediate disadvantage just because of their moral belief or can vegans compete against the world’s top athletes? One may not be aware that vegans are prone to nutritional deficiencies. Protein, vitamin-B12, iron, and other nutrients require more work to meet healthy levels. This “healthy level” gets even higher for athletes because of the amount of energy they expend and the toll training takes on the body. On the flip side, studies have shown vegans respond better to creatine supplements which could lead to better recovery and muscular hypertrophy ([Norris][Norris]{:target="_blank"}). Based on these findings, vegan athletes could even have an advantage over their meat eating opponents. 

First thing that may pop into the mind of an athlete considering the vegan route is whether or not they can get enough protein. Getting the proper amount of protein in an athlete’s diet is essential to performance. According to Nick Mitchell, the founder of Ultimate Performance, “a diet including meat and fish is essential if you want to make the best possible gains” ([Jackson][Jackson]{:target="_blank"}). He mentions that he respects those who have ethical beliefs or religious beliefs for not eating meat, but that they will be at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to making muscular gains. Mitchell recalls training a vegetarian bodybuilder for a magazine cover shoot and needing to persuade him to get the body he wanted. In Mitchell’s opinion, the vegetarian showed clear signs that his diet was not gonna cut it. He says his client “would never have achieved such incredible results if he hadn’t turned carnivore” ([Jackson][Jackson]{:target="_blank"}). Do all vegetarians need to make the switch to a carnivorous diet in order to get the body they want? From the viewpoint of vegan bodybuilder and nutritionist Derek Tresize, animal protein is not only non-essential but could even have adverse effects. “Let’s get one thing straight: there’s not much in animal foods that can’t be found in plants,” says Tresize ([Jackson][Jackson]{:target="_blank"}). Tresize claims that the only benefits animal meat has over plant foods is their high concentration of protein and their creatine levels. Hitting the needed amount of protein is not difficult if one restricts their foods to only plants. A huge part of being a bodybuilder isn’t just having a lot of muscle. A competitor needs that muscle to appear hard and sculpted and to achieve this look one needs to have a low amount of body fat. According to Tresize, “eating plants will provide all the essential nutrients you need to build healthy lean body mass” ([Jackson][Jackson]{:target="_blank"}).

Another big question when it comes to vegan diets is the vitamin B12. Unlike protein, vitamin B12 can only naturally be found in animal products. B12 is used in the division of red bloods cells, without it humans are more prone to heart attack, stroke, and even blindness. Kris Gunnars, CEO of Authority Nutrition, listed B12 deficiency as his number one reason why “vegan diets are a terrible idea” ([Gunnars][Gunnars]{:target="_blank"}). Although, vitamin B12 cannot be naturally found in plant food it can be supplemented without needing any animals. According to Jack Norris of Vegan Health, “vitamin B12 is made by bacteria such that it does not need to be obtained from animal products” ([Norris][Norris]{:target="_blank"}). This is good news for vegans who chose the diet for ethical reasons rather than health reasons. Norris demonstrates the effectiveness of B12 supplementation by pointing to a study that observed B12 levels in vegans taking B12 supplements were at healthy levels. However, while it is possible to supplement vitamin B12, Gunnars claims “a whopping 92% of vegans are deficient in this critical nutrient” ([Gunnars][Gunnars]{:target="_blank"}). Dave Asprey of Bulletproof, goes so far as to attribute vitamin B12 deficiency as part of the reason for Olympian athlete Carl Lewis’ decline following his switch to a vegan diet. Asprey, along with Gunnars, also claims that a majority of vegans are deficient in B12. The importance of getting enough B12 is especially important when we consider athletes. Some athletes spend thousands of dollars buying state of the art equipment just to shave a couple seconds off their time. For athletes at this level, monitoring vitamin B12 levels is paramount.

Athletes are at a greater risk to iron deficiency than most humans because of the amount of energy they use in their various sports. Iron exits the body through bodily fluids like sweat, urine, and blood. Iron, unlike vitamin B12, can be replenished through plant or animals foods. On top of that, the amount of iron contained in plant and animal foods is mixed, meaning animal food does not always have more iron than plant food and visa versa. However, the problems in lies the body’s ability to absorb these two sources of iron. There are two types of iron, heme iron, iron from animal sources, and non-heme iron, iron from plants. According to an article in Running & FitNews, “heme iron provides up to 33% of all absorbed dietary iron” ([Running & FitNews][Running & FitNews]{:target="_blank"}).  The article also points to two main reasons people suffer iron deficiencies: increased iron needs and decreased iron absorption. Since our bodies cannot make iron and therefore rely on food to provide iron, decreased iron absorption is often related to not eating meats. There are ways, however, for those who have sworn off eating meat, to get the proper amount of iron without animal products. One way is to pair non-heme iron rich foods with foods high in vitamin C. Running & FitNews states, “foods containing vitamin C also enhance non-heme iron absorption when eaten at the same meal” ([Running & FitNews][Running & FitNews]{:target="_blank"}). Just as there are foods that can increase iron absorption, there are also foods that can decrease absorption. Foods such as coffee, tea, and whole grains are composed of substances like polyphenols, phytates, or calcium, which should be avoided when eating non-heme iron.

The measure of a natural compound called creatine monohydrate is on average lower in vegetarians than in carnivores. Creatine is often associated with improving recovery time by decreasing muscle fatigue and building strength and power. For athletes training for power sports like football, bodybuilding, and sprinting, having lower creatine levels could affect performance. Our liver is able to create creatine, but meat eaters do get more through the creatine in animals’ muscles. Creatine is often supplemented in athletes with any diet to become bigger, faster, and stronger. An article on Vegan Health by Jack Norris states that vegetarians taking a creatine supplement may find better improvements than meat eaters who take a creatine supplement. According to Norris, “supplementing with creatine has been shown to increase performance especially in people whose creatine levels in muscle were initially on the lower side of normal” ([Norris][Norris]{:target="_blank"}). “Your sport should be a major factor” ([Novakovich][Novakovich]{:target="_blank"}), says Jennifer Novakovich in an article titled “Do Plant-based Athletes Need Creatine,” when choosing whether or not vegan athletes need creatine. Sports whose primary goal is endurance and not strength or body weight driven may not need to supplement their diet with creatine.

While an athlete who opts for a vegan diet may have a greater potential for nutritional deficits, there may be an advantage to not eating meat. Ben Greenfield, of Ben Greenfield Fitness, wrote an article discussing the the advantages of a vegan diet for athletes, particularly the improved recovery time. According to Greenfield, eating meat and other animal products make one’s body have higher acidity levels. He states, “the logic is that an excessively acidic blood pH could result in inflammation, and thus impair recovery” ([Greenfield][Greenfield]{:target="_blank"}). Brendan Brazier, author of Thrive: The Vegan Nutrition Guide to Optimal Performance in Sports and Life also discusses his experience with training on a meatless diet. Brazier’s motivation to eat vegan was not fueled by ethical reasons but rather, he found his performance was at its peak when he was on a vegan diet. Brazier discusses his experimentation process of various diets in the introduction of his book. He mentions the wide held belief in the industry that adopting a vegan diet will make you fail. Brazier tried anyways and was shocked by the outcome, saying, “the result was astounding. Not only did my recovery time plummet but my energy level, strength-to-weight ratio, and endurance shot up” ([Brazier][Brazier]{:target="_blank"}). Since his recovery time improved, Brazier described that he was able to train more frequently and realized he could become a professional Ironman racer, a dream of his since the age of fifteen.

Vegan athletes may have to monitor their food and its nutrients more than carnivores, but it is certainly not impossible to meet the requirements. Athletes should makes sure that they are getting enough protein, vitamin B12, and iron in their diet. They should keep in mind that the protein requirement for athletes is often higher than non-athletes because of the amount of calories they burn and muscle that needs to be repaired. Vitamin B12 only occurs naturally in meat, but fortunately can be biologically created and supplemented without any animals. Athletes are also especially prone to iron deficiency. The reason being that loss of sweat, urine, and blood contribute to lower iron levels. Vegan athletes should consider eating foods high in iron with foods high in vitamin C to increase absorption. While creatine levels are lower in vegans, high levels of creatine are not needed for sports focusing on lower body weight and endurance. However for sports that emphasize power and strength, creatine can be supplemented. Creatine is often supplemented by meat eating athletes regardless and studies have shown vegans react better to creatine supplementation than do meat eaters. Lastly, there may be some benefits for athletes who do no eat meat. Since meat decreases the body’s pH levels making it more acidic and possibly making recovery harder, eating a diet that result in a better pH balance could decrease recovery time and allow an athlete to train more frequently. So who wins in a race between a vegan and an carnivore? The answer could be as simple as, the better athlete.
