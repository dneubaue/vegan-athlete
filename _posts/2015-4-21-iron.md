In case you are unaware, the iron in animal products differs from the iron in plants. The problem is not that iron is less abundant in plant sources, it is that iron from animals, or heme iron, is absorbed easier than plant iron, or non-heme iron. However this is easy to combat with the right strategy. Vitamin C has been shown to increase the absorption of non-heme iron. Preparing meals with foods high in iron and vitamin C — such as pasta with tomato sauce and spinach — will increase the amount of iron you absorb from the spinach. You should also avoid consuming calcium when eating iron rich foods because calcium is known to hinder your body’s ability to absorb iron.[[3]](http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a2h&AN=80139320&site=ehost-live){:target="_blank"}
