First off, I have someting to confess, I am not a vegan. Surprised? I assume you may be wondering what a carnivore like me is doing writing a website on the vegan diet. Truth is I am not a vegan and I don’t see myself becoming one. However, my brother is a vegan. He is a big proponent of eliminating meat from one’s diet and believes a healthier lifestyle with result. I, on the other hand, love meat. So much in fact, that part of the reason I went to school in Texas was the Texas BBQ and I always believed that humans were meant to eat meat, and eliminating it was simply unnatural. In the spirit of brotherly rivalry, I set out in search of reasons to persuade my brother back to the dark side of eating meat. Vegan Athlete is a result of my findings.
