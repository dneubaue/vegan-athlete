<p>Through my research, I have come to the conclusion that athletes can, not only compete on a vegan diet, but thrive on it. Many of the concerns athletes have of becoming a vegan are valid, but are usually blown out of proportion. It may be harder to get some nutrients like protein and iron on a vegan diet, but it surely is not impossible. There is a plethora a successful vegan athletes who can attest to this. While I do think being an elite athlete on a vegan diet is feasible, I am skeptical to believe it is the optimal diet for achieving oneâ€™s athletic goals. Having said that, many people are vegan because of religious, health, or ethical reasons and it is important to know that this audience is not at a distinct disadvantage because of their beliefs.</p>
