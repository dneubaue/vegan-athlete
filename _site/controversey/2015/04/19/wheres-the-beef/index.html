<p>Some would say being a vegan athlete is somewhat of an oxymoron, an impossible pairing, a union of elements belonging to two disjoint sets. In one group we have vegans, people who choose not to eat meat or any animal products for health, environmental, or ethical reasons. On the other side exist athletes. Humans who push their bodies to the limits to become bigger, faster, and stronger. An athleteâ€™s body takes a major toll during workouts depleting itself of essential nutrients and relies on proper nutrition to fully recover. Are vegans at a distinct athletic disadvantage because they refuse to eat meat? Or is the necessity of meat merely a social norm spread throughout the sports industry?</p>
