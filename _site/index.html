    <p>Some would say being a vegan athlete is somewhat of an oxymoron, an impossible pairing, a union of elements belonging to two disjoint sets. In one group we have vegans, people who choose not to eat meat or any animals byproducts for health, environmental, or ethical reasons. On the other side exists the athletes. Humans who push their bodies to the limits to become bigger, faster, and stronger. An athlete’s body takes a major toll during workouts depleting itself of essential nutrients and rely on their proper nutrition to fully recover. Are vegans at a distinct athletic disadvantage because they refuse to eat meat? Or is the necessity of meat merely a social norm spread throughout the sports industry?</p>

      <h1>One Man's Opinion</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Through my research, I have come to the conclusion that athletes can, not only compete on a vegan diet, but thrive on it. Many of the concerns athletes have of becoming a vegan are valid, but are usually blown out of proportion. It may be harder to get some nutrients like protein and iron on a vegan diet, but it surely is not impossible. There is a plethora a successful vegan athletes who can attest to this. While I do think being an elite athlete on a vegan diet is feasible, I am skeptical to believe it is the optimal diet for achieving one’s athletic goals. Having said that, many people are vegan because of religious, health, or ethical reasons and it is important to know that this audience is not at a distinct disadvantage because of their beliefs.</p>
